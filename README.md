# HTTP-server
  Multithreaded HTTP Server : A server having more than one thread is known as Multithreaded Server. When a Client sends the request, a thread is created through which a user can communicate to the server. In this project I have created multiple threads to accept multiple requests from clients at the same time.
The main purpose of creating this server is to handle the requests of multiple clients at the same time. In this project my pc will be server which should be able to establish connection to the browser and able to handle multiple requests from browser at the same time.
